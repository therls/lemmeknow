# Lemmeknow (paused development)

## What is it?
Lemmeknow is a web app that allows users to search through global news in order to find articles related to three specific categories: entertainment, sports, and technology.

It was created to satisfy the coding challenge requirement for the  Capital One Software Engineering Summit application.

Interested? See Lemmeknow in action [here](https://google.com) or check out the code by following the instructions in the ["Installation"](https://github.com/therls/lemmeknow#installation) section.

## Installation

First, make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed.

Next, open the command line if on Windows or terminal if on Mac, then cd into the project folder.

Then, do the following:
